# Bash Util

Now with 100% Gitter: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.svg)](https://gitter.im/aztecrex/bash-util)

I put these into a Dropbox folder then source them from
```.bashrc``` on each machine I use.

For example:

```bash
for f in ~/Dropbox/Bash/setup_*.sh; do
    . $f
done
```
